# 🔐 Steganography Using ASCII Technique

This project implements a basic form of **image steganography** where a **text message is securely hidden within an image** by encoding the ASCII values of characters into the pixel values of the image. The encryption technique is simple XOR-based, and this solution demonstrates how digital images can be used for secure message transmission.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In a digital world where privacy and security are paramount, simply encrypting a message may not be enough. This project aims to **embed encrypted messages within images** using steganography techniques to hide the presence of the message itself.

---

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `OpenCV (cv2)` – for image processing
  - `NumPy` – for numerical manipulation

- **Concept Used:**
  - ASCII encoding of text
  - Simple XOR encryption with a key
  - Pixel-wise embedding into RGB channels

---

## 🧠 Algorithm & Deployment

### 🔐 **Encryption/Embedding:**
1. User inputs a message and a secret key.
2. Each character of the message is converted into its ASCII value.
3. The ASCII value is XORed with a key character.
4. The result is embedded into image pixel channels (`R`, `G`, `B`).
5. Save the modified image.

### 🔓 **Decryption/Extraction:**
1. Load the stego image.
2. Enter the same secret key.
3. Extract XORed ASCII values from pixels.
4. XOR them again with the key to get original characters.

## 📷 Result

- The original image remains visually unchanged.
- The hidden message is securely embedded.
- Only users with the correct key can recover the message.
- Wrong keys lead to garbage or unreadable output.
